            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I am a product leader who helps nonprofits and enterprises enhance their user experience through strong consumer science, management, and leadership skills in a conscientious way.

                Currently, I am a 2nd-year master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information studying in Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience.
                
                As a product leader, I recognized the importance of community and communication. I look forward to gaining experience in navigating products within the organization and creating products that satisfy all stakeholdersâ€™ needs by coordinating with technology, business, and design.
